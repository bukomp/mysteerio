# Description
In this repository, you will discover my problem-solving approaches and final solutions for the application tasks presented by Mysteeriö Oy. The tasks presented unique and engaging challenges. 

**[The first](./a)** involved deciphering a pattern from a series of recorded time intervals to determine whether a pot of water boiled at the same time during every cooking session. I created a function to analyze the overlaps in these intervals and tested its accuracy with a bespoke unit test.

**[The second](./b)** task required devising an economically efficient plan to connect a group of islands with bridges, with the aim of minimizing construction costs. I achieved this by implementing Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm, which efficiently computed the minimal sum of bridge lengths. To ensure the reliability of my implementation, I created unit tests.

In each case, I approached the problems analytically and implemented practical solutions, backed up with appropriate testing to validate the results.

## Disclaimer

*The reason there isn't any history in this Git repository is due to the specific requirements set forth by Mysteeriö Oy. They provided an exclusive coding environment for the execution of these tasks, which didn't necessitate the creation of a repository. Consequently, all the development work was carried out and contained within their specified platform, and this repository has been created solely for the purpose of presenting the completed solutions.*
