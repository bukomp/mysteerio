## Task:

Leaders of the Microisles want to connect all the islands with bridges while spending as little money as possible. The cost depends on how long the bridges are. I need to figure out the best way to connect the islands with bridges so the spendings would stay minimal.

## Solution:

I solved this problem by studying multiple algorithms for this solution and finding that Kruskal's MST (Minimum Spanning Tree) algorithm would suit this problem perfectly, as it enables me to calculate the minimal sum of the bridges between islands. I used said algorithm in my implementation.
